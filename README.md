# Sentiment-Analysis
This project presents a Tweet Sentiment Analysis Tool using machine learning 
techniques. Social media sentiment is a critical indicator for brands, public figures, and 
organizations. Analysing tweet sentiments in real-time provides actionable insights into 
customer or public perception. 
In this project, a dataset of tweets was cleaned and pre-processed. A pipeline using TF- 
IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression classifier was trained to classify sentiments as 
positive, neutral, or negative. The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 68%, 
with plans for improvement using advanced NLP techniques like BERT in the future. 
The system is designed to be intuitive, with a clean web-based user interface that allows 
anyone to input a tweet or batch of tweets and get sentiment predictions with minimal 
effort.
